# Prototype_pattern
The prototype pattern example project.
Done with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x00IewDdrUA and book "Programowanie gier. Wzorce" by Robert Nystrom.

The core role of this prototype is to made myself familiar with prototype programming pattern in Unity. 
I used it to make easy weapon system, where they are taken from ScriptableObjects as data and then used by
script placed on player's character child - WeaponPos. This is also place from we take information to choosing weapon mechanic.
